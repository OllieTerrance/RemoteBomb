Introduction

A remotely deployable bomb... okay, it's not a bomb, but it's still a thing. Load up the page on an unsuspecting computer, set a URL to go to, and leave it. Then remotely trigger it from another device (maybe your phone?) from afar. Trigger awkward songs and movies on multiple computers simultaneously, and watch from a distance as people look with confused faces. It even disguises itself as a Google 404 page (as long as you don't look at the URL...).

To prime the bomb, add a # to the end of the address, then paste a URL in. The page title should blink ">> Trigger set". To deploy the bomb, go to **rb.php?d** (the title will blink ">> Deployed"; repeat to undeploy). Please undeploy the bomb after use, so it's ready for next time. (If you attempt to prime a bomb and it redirects straight away, try to undeploy it first.)
